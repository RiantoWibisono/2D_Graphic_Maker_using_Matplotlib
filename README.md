# Simple 2D Graphic Maker Program using Flask, Numpy, and Matplotlib
A simple Python project to create a 2D graphic (X and Y axes only) using *Flask* framework, *Numpy*, *Matplotlib* (along with the pyplot package) to yield the graphic output.
1. Install numpy and matplotlib using pip package:
    ```bash
    $ pip install matplotlib
    $ pip install numpy
    ```
    Or using another writing method:
    ```bash
    $ py -m pip install matplotlib
    $ py -m pip install numpy
    ```
    
2. Clone this repo and create folder named *storage* to store the graphic output. This program will create a new graphic in that folder everytime it runs with name sorted by number. Look at the example of how the results would be:
    ![Storage](./ss1.png)

3. *Run* the program.
The home page of the program will look like this:
    ![HomeRoute](./ss2.png)
    **_Remember!_** This program would only work if the amount of axes in both X and Y are the same. Otherwise, it would be an error.

4. *Create graph!* 
    
### **_Enjoy!_**
